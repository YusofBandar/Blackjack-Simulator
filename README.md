# Blackjack-Simulator
Simulates 1000's of Blackjack games

#### The goal of this app is:

* Run or simulate a blackjack game n times
* Based on that make the best possible moves (as a player) that gives you the highest chance of winning (see the Blackjack Chart.png)
* Compute how often each player has won, lost and tied
* Add further features like set a bet and display at the end of simulation how much they earned or quite if they are broke

#### So the UI for it at the first version is really:

* A input where you can set how often you want to simulate the game
* A button that kicks off the code
* A visible paragraph / div that displays the result

#### UI for later Versions:

* Toggles if you want the players to use double down or Split
* Input of how much you want to bed each round
