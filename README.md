# Blackjack-Simulator
Simulates 1000's of Blackjack games

#### The goal of this app is:

* Run or simulate a blackjack game n times
* Based on that make the best possible moves (as a player) that gives you the highest chance of winning
* Compute of often the computer has won and how often he has lost
* Add further features like set a bet and display at the end of simulation how much they earned or quite if they are broke

##### So the UI for it at the first version is really:

* A inpout where you can set how often you want to simulate the game
* A button that kicks off the code
* A visible paragraph / div that displays the result

For later version there could be features like options:

* If you want to split or never split
* If you want to double down or not, ... 

The basics of the game blackjack are in the file "notes.MD".
